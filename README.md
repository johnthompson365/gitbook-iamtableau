# Welcome friends

A great quote I saw recently from [@KelseyHightower](https://twitter.com/kelseyhightower/status/1343116529664069634) was "Question everything and share what you learn". Well, this is me sharing.

I work for Tableau as a Strategic Solution Engineer, and specialise in Security, Identity, Integration and Authentication subjects. This GitBook is intended as an effort to shine a light on some of these subjects and help the \#datafam and Tableau community. 

These docs are not official Tableau content, and don't represent the views of my employer.
