# Welcome friends

I recently read a great quote from [@KelseyHightower](https://twitter.com/kelseyhightower/status/1343116529664069634)...

## "Question everything and share what you learn".

Well, this is me sharing.

I work for Tableau as a Distinguished Solution Engineer, and specialize in Security, Identity, Integration and Authentication subjects. This GitBook is intended as an effort to shine a light on some of these subjects and help the \#datafam and Tableau community.

These docs are not official Tableau content, and don't represent the views of my employer.

If there are errors or areas for improvement or suggestions for content please raise an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/johnthompson365/gitbook-tableau), or _Edit on Github_ yourself using the link on the page and raise a PR.

## Content

The approach I am taking with Gitbook is to use this as my note taker and blog. I just wanted to stop the barrier to publishing that is 'perfect'. Also, I thought it would be useful for a bit of transparency in the process of learning and writing the docs.

### Recipes

A structured way to make you successful with a solution. Usually step by step guidance with occasional detours.

### Notes

If the article has a _Notes_ prefix, it is intended as just that; quick notes on my work for future reference. Often, used whilst learning and something for me to go back to and pick up, save me jumping around the internet again.

### Drafts

You know it'll be rough and ready, or incomplete at best!
