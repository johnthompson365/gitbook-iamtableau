# Draft: Azure AD SAML and Tableau Online

Microsoft provides an Azure AD that can be used to integrate Tableau Server and Tableau Online into Azure AD. The main distinction between the two apps is that Tableau Online app allows you to do user provisioning as well as authentication.

### TOL SAML Authentication

There are articles to configure the authentication steps. The Microsoft ones are little simpler to follow as they have screenshots.

**Tableau Docs:** [https://help.tableau.com/current/online/en-us/saml\_config\_azure\_ad.htm](https://help.tableau.com/current/online/en-us/saml_config_azure_ad.htm)  
**Microsoft Docs:** [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/saas-apps/tableauonline-tutorial](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/saas-apps/tableauonline-tutorial)

### Attributes

There are two main properties that TOL is interested in, your **Email** and **Display Name**:

#### Email

_Enter the name of the IdP assertion that contains the email address sent from the IdP to Tableau Online during the authentication process. The user is authenticated if the IdP email address is an exact match for the user's email address as stored in Tableau._

The guidance we give on the attributes to use has some nuance.

* If all accounts youâ€™re giving access to are sourced from **Microsoft accounts** \(e.g. outlook.com/gmail.com, or any consumer email domain that has signed up for an account\) this will be: `http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/emailaddress`
* If all accounts are sourced from **Microsoft Azure Active Directory**, use the following value:

  `http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/name`.

**Display Name:** Enter an assertion name for either the first name and last name, or for the full name, depending on how the IdP stores this information. Tableau Online uses these attributes to set the display name.

* `http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/givenname`
* `http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/surname`
* `http://schemas.microsoft.com/identity/claims/displayname`

So you can select either `givenname` + `surname` OR `displayname`
