# Welcome friends

I recently read a great quote from [@KelseyHightower](https://twitter.com/kelseyhightower/status/1343116529664069634),

### "Question everything and share what you learn".

Well, this is me sharing.

I work for Tableau as a Strategic Solution Engineer, and specialise in Security, Identity, Integration and Authentication subjects. This GitBook is intended as an effort to shine a light on some of these subjects and help the \#datafam and Tableau community.

These docs are not official Tableau content, and don't represent the views of my employer. 

If there are errors or areas for improvement or suggestions for content please raise an issue on GitHub.

### Content

The approach I am taking with Gitbook is to use this as my note taker and blog. If the article has a _Notes:_ prefix, it is intended as just that; quick notes on my work for future reference. If it doesn't have a prefix then it is more of a specific article hopefully with structure and purpose. If it says _Draft_ then you know it'll be partial or rough and ready. I just wanted to stop the barrier to publishing that is 'perfect'.

NB. "Welcome friends" is lovingly appropriated from [@shanselman](https://twitter.com/shanselman)
