description: Here is what I learned when testing out Tableau Online SAML with Okta
---

# Okta apps and Tableau

## **Scope**

The testing focuses on the integrations between Tableau Online and Okta for SAML authentication. This is the core SAML authentication functionality to get a user securely logged on, not advanced configuration or user provisioning.

## **Okta Application Features**

There are two published apps in the [Okta Integration Network \(OIN\)](https://help.okta.com/en/prod/Content/Topics/Apps/Apps_Apps.htm). One for Tableau Online \(TOL\) and the other for Tableau Server. They have a different SAML feature set which you need to be aware of. The Okta Tableau Online application supports the following three SAML features; and it is not just authentication the TOL app provides but also it has [SCIM for user provisioning](https://help.tableau.com/current/online/en-us/scim_config_online.htm).

1. SP-initiated SSO
2. IdP-initiated SSO
3. SP-Initiated Single Logout \(SLO\)
4. **SCIM user provisioning**

The Tableau Server Okta App supports the same features **apart** from SCIM. Also note neither apps support [IdP-initiated SLO](https://blog.bio-key.com/2016/06/20/saml-single-logout-need-to-know)_._

### Okta Developer Tenant

Sign up for an Okta Developer Tenant. The tenant is permanent and will allow you to test out all the features you need:

## **Documentation**

I don't want to duplicate setup instructions here as Okta and Tableau docs do a good job. To be honest I found the Okta instructions better than the Tableau Online ones as they had screenshots. However the Okta Tableau Server ones look out of date.

**Okta Setup Resources:**  
[How to Configure SAML 2.0 for Tableau Online](https://saml-doc.okta.com/SAML_Docs/How-to-Configure-SAML-2.0-for-Tableau-Online.html)  
[How to Configure SAML 2.0 for Tableau Server](https://saml-doc.okta.com/SAML_Docs/How-to-Configure-SAML-2.0-for-Tableau-Server.html) -&gt; _this has out of date screenshots - pre-TSM_

[SAML](https://help.tableau.com/current/server/en-us/saml.htm) - Tableau Server general SAML guidance

## **SAML Configuration**

The key setup configuration items for SAML are described below, I tested TOL but have included some information such as the Return URL and Certificates which are only required by a Tableau Server deployment. Surprisingly, Okta does not require \(or support\) the uploading of the Service Provider Metadata to complete the configuration using metadata exchange, so you have to input details manually.

        The value of the entityID attribute SHOULD be the canonical URL of the
        entity&apos;s metadata document. An example from TOL: <b>entityID=&quot;</b>

        the IdP can ensure that the user&apos;s information is sent only to authorized
        locations. An example from TOL: <b>Location=&quot;</b><a href="https://sso.online.tableau.com/public/sp/SSO/4b728bd1-df88-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx">https://sso.online.tableau.com/public/sp/SSO/4b728bd1-df88-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx</a><b>&quot;</b>

        <p>One thing to be aware of is that by default Tableau Server currently uses

## Validation Tests

After completing any configuration I usually go through and write validation tests to confirm the setup is working as expected. This was how I found the lack of support for SLO mentioned above. Here are the tests I completed as a starting point.

| **Test** | **Actions** | **Result** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Tableau Sign in with SAML user | Add username and select Sign In Redirect to Okta to insert password Redirected in to TOL | Success |
| Okta Sign in with SAML user | Sign in to Okta with credentials.  Click on Tableau Online and enter portal | Success |
| Sign in with MFA | MFA enforced by Okta policy | Success |
| Sign out from Okta | Select sign out from app in Okta | Failed: Expected to fail as IdP-initiated SLO not supported |
| Sign out from Tableau | Go to Tableau user profile Select Sign out | Success |
| Sign in with Local user from Tableau | Go to Tableau sign in, login with local user | Success: login and no redirection to Okta |

## SSO Summary

It is simple to get up and running with Tableau and Okta using the provided apps from Okta for both Tableau Online and Server. The key point to understand are the features provided by each app. The Tableau Online app provides support for SCIM user and group provisioning. The Tableau Server app purely delivers SAML authentication \(no SCIM\), neither apps support IdP-Initiated SLO.

## Lifecycle Management

Lifecycle Management is a grand title for the process to manage the accounts that access your services. A simple way to think of it is the Joiners, Movers and Leavers in your organization. We will narrow the focus down to how you provision users and groups into Tableau.

### Tableau Server

Okta's Tableau Server application does not support provisioning, only authentication. So to provision users and groups to the server we need to look at another method to do that. Okta's Universal Directory has an LDAP interface which means this can be connected to as a Tableau External Identity Store.

{% embed url="https://interworks.com/blog/2020/05/06/connecting-tableau-server-to-okta-universal-directory/" %}

The article above is great as it shows how to sync from Active Directory as well. There are steps that describe how you can deploy the Okta AD agent to synchronize users between Okta and Active Directory. These users and groups that originated in AD are now in the Okta Universal Directory, and can then be imported into Tableau using the [Okta LDAP interface](https://help.okta.com/en/prod/Content/Topics/Directory/LDAP-interface-main.htm) to bind with Tableau, just as you would with any LDAP service. 

### Tableau Online

The Okta app for Tableau Online supports SCIM User provisioning. As mentioned above the Okta TOL app has provisioning built into it. 

#### Features

The main features it supports are:

* Create, Update and Deactivate
* Group Push and Group Linking

#### Considerations

There are instructions on the configuration in our [Help docs](https://help.tableau.com/current/online/en-us/scim_config_online.htm) for both Okta and OneLogin. 

There are a number of considerations listed in our docs. I have included two constraints that could impact provisioning:

> **Important:** The secret token is displayed only immediately after it is generated. If you lose it before you can apply it to your IdP, you can select Generate New Secret. In addition, the secret token is tied to the Tableau Online user account of the site administrator who enables SCIM support. If that userâ€™s site role changes or the user is removed from the site, the secret token becomes invalid, and another site administrator must generate a new secret token and apply it to your IdP.

Not all Tableau features are supported with the app:

> Use of SCIM with [Grant License on Sign In](https://help.tableau.com/current/online/en-us/grant_role.htm) is unsupported and may result in incorrectly provisioned site roles for users or groups.

Please read all the documentation.

#### Test Cases



When configuring the app you have three options Create, Update and Deactivate.

Despite what the screenshot shows this isn't the full story there are limitations in the way it works.

#### Create Users

#### Update User Attributes

#### 

**Matching Users**

The Okta TOL app is designed to _create or **link** users in TOL when assigning the app to a user in Okta._ I wanted to test out the link part of it as well as create!

When enabling the provisioning of my chosen AD group I intentionally picked a group that already had a user enabled in TOL \(Ahmed Kroner\). After the assignment of the AD group it reported a couple of errors. These were related to a new user from AD not in TOL \(Alona Marr\) and a Okta user that was not part of the provisioned AD group \(John Thompson\).  

![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%28125%29.png)

Login successful with Ahmed - showed that the account was linked.

Alona I had to remove the AD group and assign it a second time to the app for the user to be provisioned.

#### Deactivate Users
